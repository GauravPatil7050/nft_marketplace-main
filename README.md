NFT Marketplace Project Readme


This README file provides an overview and documentation for the NFT Marketplace project, which utilizes Solidity for writing Smart Contracts, JavaScript for building the front-end with React, Ethers for interacting with the blockchain, Hardhat as the development framework, IPFS for metadata storage, and React Router for navigational components.



Project Overview



The NFT Marketplace project is a decentralized platform that allows users to create, buy, sell, and trade NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a particular item or piece of content. This project combines the power of blockchain technology and IPFS for storing and displaying metadata associated with these NFTs.

Technologies Used



Solidity: Smart contract development language for Ethereum.
JavaScript: Used for building the front-end with React and writing tests.
Ethers: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
Hardhat: A development framework for Ethereum smart contract development.
IPFS: InterPlanetary File System for storing and retrieving NFT metadata.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: A library for handling navigation in a React application.



Project Structure


The project is organized into two main components:

Smart Contracts: This directory contains the Solidity smart contracts that power the NFT marketplace.

Marketplace.sol: The main smart contract for creating, buying, and selling NFTs.
NFT.sol: A contract for representing the NFTs themselves.
Migrations.sol: Truffle migrations for deploying contracts.
Frontend: This directory contains the React-based front-end application.

src/: Contains the React components, styles, and application logic.
contracts/: Contains the artifacts generated by Hardhat when compiling smart contracts.
hardhat.config.js: Configuration file for the Hardhat development environment.
scripts/: Contains utility scripts for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.
public/: Static assets, including HTML files.
